## Week 1

We can take our first steps with saghirb's [Getting Started in R](https://github.com/saghirb/Getting-Started-in-R).

## Week 2

Project organization and reading excel files with [readxl](https://readxl.tidyverse.org).

## Week 3

Managing spreadsheets presents some chaallenges to data scientists.
This article on [Data Organization in Spreadsheets](https://doi.org/10.1080/00031305.2017.1375989) may help with some of the issues with managing spreadsheets.
Typical issues include the following.

* Unintended white space (space, tabs, etc.) in cells
* Use of coloring in spreadsheet that is not read into R
* The comment character (frequently '#') is used in  a data cell
* Dates are handled incorrectly
* Mixing upper and lower case (e.g., Person vs. person)

This mneans that most projects have a phase where spreadsheet data need quality control before it can be analysed.

Example spreadsheet data.

Example GenAlEx data.

Example FASTA data.
